# :warning: Godot is unmaintained. There are [better projects out there](https://github.com/passy/build-time-tracker-plugin), use them ðŸ™‚

What is Godot?
==============

Do you like waiting? Godot is for passionate thumb-twiddlers of the quantified-self-era. A Gradle plugin to help you keep track of how much time you spend waiting for builds to finish.

### Isn't that like the `--profile` option in Gradle?

`--profile` only summarizes the timing of one build, whereas Godot keeps track of
how your build duration changes over time.

How to use this
---------------

Add the following to your project's root `build.gradle`:

```Groovy
buildScript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
  }
  dependencies {
    // ... other buildscript dependencies, e.g. the Android Gradle plugin
    classpath 'de.hannesstruss:godot:+'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'de.hannesstruss.godot'
```

When the plugin is applied, it'll keep information about how long each of your
builds took. Continue working for a couple of days, then run

    ./gradlew generateGodotReport

and Godot will generate a [nice report][4] with some charts.

Without configuration, the logfile for your builds will be kept in the `GRADLE_USER_HOME` directory which defaults
to `~/.gradle`. If you'd rather keep it in your project's build directory, you can configure your `build.gradle` like
this:

    godot.persistLog = false

Be aware that a `gradle clean` will then remove the logfile.
